# Pricing and Invoicing

[BorgBase](https://www.borgbase.com) uses a combination of fixed and variable billing. First you would choose a plan, based on your overall backup needs. Currently we offer the following plans:

### Available Plans

- Free plan: Includes 10 GB backup space
- Small plan: Includes 100 GB backup space
- Medium plan: Includes 1 TB backup space
- Large plan: Includes 2 TB backup space

For full details on current plans, see the [fronpage](https://www.borgbase.com/) or checkout page.

### Flexible Ex-Post Billing

Once you are on a plan, you can also use a flexible quota of up to 3x the space included in your base plan and only pay what you actually use. E.g.:

> You choose the small plan, which includes 100 GB with an overall limit of 400 GB (100 GB + 300 GB flexible quota). The first 100 GB are included in your plan. Then, if you need more space on a short-term basis, you can use the flexible quota and pay-as-you-go.

Additional data is calculated on a daily basis and you can view your daily usage and total overage cost under [*Account > Billing*](https://www.borgbase.com/account?tab=5). An invoice will be generated, once the amount is high enough or when you renew your plan.

### Custom Plans

If none of our pre-set plans is right for you, we are happy to create a custom plan for you. To do so, just send a short email to [hello@borgbase.com](mailto:hello@borgbase.com).

## Changing Plans

If you find that your current plan is not a good fit, despite the flexible quota, you can always change your plan. To do so, just choose a different plan during checkout. The new plan will start after your old plan expires, so you can extend or change your plan any time.

### Changing Plans Immediately

If you prefer to use your new plan right away, we will pro-rate the remaining time. To do so, first buy your new plan and then respond to the confirmation email with a short note about starting the new plan right away.

We will start your new plan right away and convert your old plan to additional time on the new one.
