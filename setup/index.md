# Setting up Borg for Backups to BorgBase

Borg is a lightweight backup client that you install locally to prepare your data before sending it to BorgBase for storage. Borg will deduplicate, compress and encrypt your files before sending them to us.

There are many ways to use Borg on your computer. Some popular ways are explained in the pages below. See *Command Line* for ways to set up borg on headless systems, like a NAS or a remote server. For desktops we offer Vorta, our desktop client. It provides a graphical user interface around Borg and integrates with your desktop environment to make creating, browsing and restoring backups easier.
