### Sign up with BorgBase
BorgBase is a dedicated hosting service for Borg backup repositories. It allows you to manage all your backups in one place and use powerful Borg features, like append-only mode in a simple way. 

### Local Borg Setup
Borg Backup works with most operating systems, like Linux, macOS and Windows WSL. For servers and headless systems, look into our [Command Line Setup Guide]. For desktops, we recommend using our desktop client, [Vorta](setup/vorta).
